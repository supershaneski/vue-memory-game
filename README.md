vue-memory-game
================

This project was bootstrapped with [Nuxt.JS](https://nuxtjs.org/).

## Objective
This is my third project for [Vue.Js](https://vuejs.org/).

Basically, I am trying to practice transitions which I find interesting.

This is inspired by this [github.com/leftstick/vue-memory-game](https://github.com/leftstick/vue-memory-game).

This is just a quick practice exercise.
Nothing that impressive.

I added timer and best time display from the last edit.
